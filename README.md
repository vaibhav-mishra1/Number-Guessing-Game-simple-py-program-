## 🧠 What Is This Game About?

The computer randomly selects a secret number, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts (lives).

Based on how close the guess is, the game gives helpful hints like:
- 🎯 *Too close to the number*
- 🙂 *Close, keep trying*
- 📉 *Far from the number*

The goal is to guess the correct number **before running out of lives**.
